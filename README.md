# Email_Validation_system
Developed an Email Validation System in Python to verify email formats and ensure data integrity. Utilized regular expressions (regex) to check for valid syntax, domain verification, and handle edge cases, ensuring only correctly formatted email addresses are accepted in registration or communication systems.
